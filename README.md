### Considerations

There are some things I couldn't get to:

1) select menu closes after each selection, ideally this wouldn't happen for multiselect menus
2) there is no callback function after selecting items
3) pagination only grows the list, it should ideally shrink to only what's necessary
4) there are some styling oddities
5) accessibility should be considered
